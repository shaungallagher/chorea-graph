# Chorea Graph

Chorea Graph is an open-source PhoneGap project that allows people with movement disorders to use the accelerometer in their wearable devices (fitness trackers, smart watches, etc.) to monitor chorea and tremors.  This data can then be visualized to demonstrate the efficacy of anti-tremor medication or other therapies.

Chorea Graph was inspired by Spry, a project built in 2011 as part of New Media Medicine's Health and Wellness Innovation event held at the MIT Media Lab.
